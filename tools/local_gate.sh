# local_gate.sh — the pre-commit / pre-PR gate.
#
# Run from anywhere in the repo: `bash tools/local_gate.sh`
#
# This is the single gate that must be green before every commit and before
# every PR. If your CI runs the same checks, this mirrors them locally. If CI
# is disabled, this is the ONLY gate.
#
# A red gate is fixed by CORRECTING THE CODE, never by weakening a check.
#
# Each step is a COMMAND STRING run through `bash -c`, so compound commands
# work and their exit status is still captured:
#     step "Lint" 'npm run lint && npm run format:check'
#
# An UNSET or BLANK command is a HARD FAILURE, never a silent pass — a gate
# that reports success while running nothing is worse than no gate. If your
# stack genuinely has no such step, set it to the literal `true` so the intent
# is explicit and visible.
